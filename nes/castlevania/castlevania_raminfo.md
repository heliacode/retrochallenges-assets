## RAM Address Reference

| Address | Size | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| $0012 | 02 | Various<br/>CHR Data Pointer<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points to CHR data, stored as follows:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte 0 = value for $0027; byte 1-2 = CHR data RAM address;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte 3-4 = PPU write address; byte 5-6 = data size |
| $0018 | | System State<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00 = Booting; 01 = Title Screen; 02 = Demo Mode; 03 = Start Game;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;04 = Introduction; 05 = Gameplay; 06 = Respawning; 07 = Game Over;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;08 = Door Transition; 09 = Autowalk; 0a = Entering Castle; 0b = Autoclimb;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0c = Scoring & Map; 0d = Continue; 0e = Falling; 0f = Ending |

| $0028 | | Stage (internal id — does NOT match the on-screen STAGE number; e.g. reads 20 while the HUD shows STAGE 16) |
| $0029 | | **On-screen STAGE counter** — this is the value the status bar displays. Use $0029 (not $0028) for "reach stage N" challenges. Verified by cross-referencing three savestates (HUD 7/13/16 → $0029 7/13/16). datacrystal labels it "Previous Stage" but empirically it holds the current displayed stage. |
